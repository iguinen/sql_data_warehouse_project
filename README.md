## 🌟 About Me
Hello! I am a Turkish woman living in Finland. I am a chemical engineer and currently studying to become a data engineer.

I created this project by following the instructions in “SQL Full Course for Beginners (30 Hours) – From Zero to Hero”, created by Baraa Khatib Salkini, also known as Data With Baraa. He is an IT professional and passionate YouTuber on a mission to share knowledge and make working with data enjoyable and engaging. His courses are high-quality and very well-presented — I highly recommend them!
