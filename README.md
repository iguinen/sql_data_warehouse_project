## 🌟 About Me
Hello! I am a Turkish woman living in Finland. I am a chemical engineer and am studying to become a data engineer.

I created this project following the instructions in "SQL Full Course for Beginners (30 Hours) – From Zero to Hero," created by **Baraa Khatib Salkini**, also known as **Data With Baraa**. He is an IT professional and passionate YouTuber on a mission to share knowledge and make working with data enjoyable and engaging! The courses that he created are high-quality and well-presented. I highly recommend.
